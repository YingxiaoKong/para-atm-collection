 Demonstartion of the physics and data informed aircraft dynamics model
 This covers the following:
 1. Extracting trajectory data from a public database (FlightAware)
 2. Analyzing the extracted data to detect flight phases and the following items of interest:
    (a) detecting step climb during the cruise phase, and
    (b) testing whether the aircraft was held at a constant altitude during descent
 3. Demonstration of the composite aircraft dynamics model 
    (a) Plotting the effective thrust force experienced by the aircraft]
    (b) Evaluating model form errors during various flight phases
