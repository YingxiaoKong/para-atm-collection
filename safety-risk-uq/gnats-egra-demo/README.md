# GNATS Reliability Analysis Example

This directory provides a demonstration of an air traffic simulation reliability analysis example problem.  The example problem involves a simple simulation with 2 aircraft, in whcih there are two random variables (waypoint latitude and longitude coordinates for the first aircraft), and the response quantity is based on separation distance.  Refer to [gnats-egra.ipynb](gnats-egra.ipynb) for the complete description and to run the example.
