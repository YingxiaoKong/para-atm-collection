# PARA-ATM Research Collection

This repository contains work conducted under the NASA ULI project "Information fusion for real-time national air transportation system prognostics under uncertainty", which is led by Arizona State University.  The repository directory structure is organized by topic.  The individual contributions include code and data for examples and demonstration cases developed under the project, primarily written in the Python programming language.

Many of the contributions here also make use of the [`paraatm` Python package](https://github.com/ymlasu/para-atm) and [GNATS](https://github.com/OptimalSynthesisInc/GNATS) software.  `paraatm` is a Python package that provides a suite of tools to support research and analysis of national airspace safety.  GNATS is a Generalized National Airspace Trajectory Prediction system.

For information about how to contribute, please see the [Guide for Contributing](https://github.com/ymlasu/para-atm-collection/wiki/Contributing).
